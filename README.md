# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a sorting visualization tool that allows users to visualize the process of two sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. Users can generate random numbers or input their own set of numbers, and observe how the chosen sorting algorithm rearranges the numbers to bring them into sorted order. The application also offers adjustable speed controls to vary the animation speed of the sorting process.

## Features

- Visualize the process of Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms.
- Generate random numbers and visualize their sorting.
- Input custom numbers and visualize their sorting.
- Adjustable speed controls for the sorting animation.

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript, React, Tailwind, Vite
